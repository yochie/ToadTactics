IMPORTANT NOTE  : types listed here are only for ideal reference, not actually implemented as such YET as of writing this. They would need to be as listed to have only immutable datatypes synced with mirror sync* variables.

IMPORTANT NOTE : this needs updating... might be better to just look at code...
