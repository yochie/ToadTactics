IMPORTANT NOTE  : types listed here are only for ideal reference, not actually implemented as such YET as of writing this. They would need to be as listed to have only immutable datatypes synced with mirror sync* variables.

IMPORTANT NOTE : this needs updating... might be better to just look at code...


Game state

    map
        dict<vector, struct Hex> hex dictionnary where each hex can hold or be marked as
            struct hexCoordinate
            vector worldPosition
            enum obstacleType
            int playerIndex
            struct treasure
            enum hazardType (along with consequent moveCost)            
            bool startingZone
            int StartingZone for player (along with basecolor)

    gamecontroller
        array[2]<Player> of players each with
            int/bool index (host:0 or client:1)
            bool isMyTurn
            int score
            array[3]<struct character> of owned characters each with
                struct hexCoordinate their position on board (or lack thereof)
                list<struct treasure> their current equipped treasures
                list<struct buff> their current buffs/debuffs
                int their current life
                int (x4) their remaning ability/treasure/moves/attack uses
                struct charStats their current stats (base stats modified by buffs and gear, so could technically be recomputed based on other data)
                int the player they are owned by
